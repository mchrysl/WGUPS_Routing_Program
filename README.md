The WGUPS Scenario

  This paper is the required analysis of a program developed for the Western Governors University Parcel Service. The goal of this program is to unite at least one self-adjusting data structure, hashing algorithms, and at least one named algorithm to route delivery trucks to meet the package delivery needs of the WGUPS. The paper analyzes the Big-O complexity and efficiency of the developed program, details the development environment, discusses the scalability, adaptability, and maintainability of the program. Also discussed are the self-adjusting data structure and algorithm implemented in the program along with other possible alternatives. Screenshots displaying the working program were included in the original paper but are not available with this.
